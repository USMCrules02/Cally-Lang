# About Cally-Lang
Dont like pythons white space but like its readability and easy of use.<br/>
Well look no further Cally Lang is here.<br/>
Cally-Lang is a great alternative if you don't care about performace, since the interpreter is written entirely in Powershell 7.4 (Compatible with 5.4 => lower version might not function properly).<br/>
Why power Shell?<br/>
